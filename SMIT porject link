    <center><img src="/62.jpg"alt=""></center>
    <p>Saylani Welfare International Trust has been working since 1999 to improve the conditions of the less privileged,
        helpless, and handicapped individuals. The organization is working day and night to make life happier,
        especially for the middle class, lower middle class and even lower class. At time of establishing the
        organization, the founder of Saylani Welfare International Trust and a few of his associates had made a
        commitment to serve the distressed people living in Pakistan and abroad in all stages of life. It is a blessing
        in disguise that today the organization is serving humanity in more than 63 areas of life without any
        discrimination.</p>
    <p>The organization started out as a rented house and today has at least 630 branches worldwide. The organization
        also has more than 630 Dastarkhwan, where thousands of employees are employed. Today, the organization spends
        more than 7 billion annually on the service and welfare of humanity. Not only this, but more than 63 spheres of
        life from birth to death (including food, health, education, social welfare, clean water, marriage, mass I.T
        training, vocational training, assistance to Syrian and Burmese refugees, pilgrim services, school services
        fees, easy loans, easy employment, hairdressing, medical & diagnostic center, laboratory tests, x-ray,
        ultrasound, ECG, consultant clinic, mobile dining, mobile clinic, mobile air care clinic & operation theater,
